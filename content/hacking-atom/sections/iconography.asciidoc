=== Iconography

Atom comes bundled with the https://github.com/github/octicons/tree/v2.1.2[Octicons 2.1.2] icon set. Use them to add icons to your packages.

==== Usage

Atom's usage of the Octicons differs just a bit from the https://octicons.github.com/icon/mark-github/[standard way]. The biggest difference is in the naming of the icon classes. Instead of the `octicon octicon-` prefix, you would use a more generic `icon icon-` prefix.

As an example, to add a monitor icon, use the `icon icon-device-desktop` classes in your markup:

```html
  <span class="icon icon-device-desktop"></span>
```

==== Overview

To see an overview of all icons open the http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/creating-a-theme/#atom-styleguide[Styleguide]. Under the "Icons" section you'll find all the Octicons that are available.

==== Size

Octicons look best with a `font-size` of `16px`. It's already used as the default, so you don't need to worry about it. In case you prefer a different icon size, try to use multiples of 16 (`32px`, `48px` etc.) for the sharpest result. Sizes in between are ok too, but might look a bit blurry for icons with straight lines.

==== Usability

Although icons can make your UI visually appealing, when used without a text label, it can be hard to guess its meaning. In cases where space for a text label is insufficient, consider adding a https://atom.io/docs/api/latest/TooltipManager[tooltip] that appears on hover. Or a more subtle `title="label"` attribute would already help as well.
